## Requirements

1. Each nginx instance must run in a separate docker container.

2. You must use the alpine:3.10 image from the public docker repository as the base of your
docker images.

3. Highly available solution. Incorporate load balancing and container
lifecycle management tools with your choice of technologies. 

5. Make sure that there are sufficient and easy‐to‐find instructions and documentation
contained within the repository so that it can be built, run, and tested.

Bonus:
1. How would this be configured to maximize availability. (documentation only)
2. What loads would this spinup be able to handle. (documentation only)
3. How would logging, security be applied. (documentation only)

This is intentionally a very open ended exercise, so there is no single right or wrong answer.
Objectives:

1. Everything runs.

2. How you approached and thought through the problem.

3. How well you know and used the features of the tools and libraries you made use of.

4. How professionally "put together" and engineered everything is.
